## General Information
This was a coursework task that was given shortly after the completion of the spellchecker project. The requirements of this task asked for the game to be created using Tkinter. The decision to make a bullet-hell type of game was quite ambitious and proved to be very challenging under the limitations of Tkinter.

During this coursework I also attempted to learn about object-oriented programming and tried to use this style of programming in the code. Although I believe that my use of this programming paradigm was flawed and not utilised to its fullest potential due to my lack of understanding at the time.

Unfortunately there are a few fundamental problems with the game
* Poor performance
* Game engine is tied to FPS
* Level design is weak and not implemented well

## Features
* Ship level-up mechanic
* Different types of enemies with different attack patterns
* Auto-save and load
* Customisable controls
* A boss key to quickly mask the program
* Scoring system with leaderboard
* Three difficulties to choose from
